# Decentralized Advertising

## Project Description

The Decentralized Advertising Platform is a revolutionary ad network that eliminates intermediaries and creates a direct connection between advertisers and viewers. Unlike traditional advertising models where platforms capture most of the value, this system ensures that users who view advertisements are directly rewarded for their attention and time.

Advertisers can create advertisement campaigns by depositing a budget and setting a reward amount per view. Users can then view these advertisements and automatically receive tokens as compensation. All transactions are transparent, immutable, and executed through smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring fair distribution of rewards without the need for trusted intermediaries.

The platform tracks advertisement budgets, view counts, and user earnings in real-time, providing complete transparency for both advertisers and users. When an advertisement's budget is exhausted, it automatically becomes inactive, preventing any overspending.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize the advertising industry by creating a fair, transparent, and user-centric ecosystem where:

- **Users Own Their Attention**: People should be compensated fairly for the time they spend viewing advertisements, not just the platforms hosting them.

- **Advertisers Get Real Engagement**: Direct interaction with viewers ensures genuine attention rather than bot-driven metrics and fraudulent impressions.

- **Transparency by Design**: Blockchain technology ensures all transactions, views, and rewards are publicly verifiable and cannot be manipulated.

- **Elimination of Middlemen**: By removing intermediaries, we reduce costs for advertisers while increasing rewards for users, creating a win-win situation.

- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with internet access can participate in the network, either as an advertiser or a viewer, regardless of geographical location or traditional banking access.

We envision a future where the advertising industry operates on principles of fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit, powered by decentralized technology that puts control back in the hands of users.

    reward_per_view: u64,
    total_budget: u64,
    remaining_budget: u64,
    total_views: u64,
    is_active: bool,
}
```
